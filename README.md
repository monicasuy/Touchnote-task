This is an app I made for a job interview with TouchNote.
The task was to create a React app that displayed cards with the Star Wars characters' name
height and hair colour with Next and Previous buttons that were disabled when the user reaches the
last and first page accordingly and a Sort button that would display the cards according to the mass of the characters.
I only know the basics of React so I know there must be things that could've been done in a better way, but I'm happy and proud of being able to figure out how to do everything that was asked of me.
The Next and Previous buttons don't work perfectly, but I unfortunately did not have the time to solve this issue. The Next button doesn't move to page 2 unless you click twice and the Previous button seems to be going to the next page the first time you click before going to the previous page the second time. I've reviewed my functions for this for a long time and tried to research online but unfortunately haven't found an answer. I am glad for the fact that at least, they do work after the second click.
The front-end isn't my best work but I did try to use the Star Wars colours and found a similar(ish) font on google fonts to try and go with the theme of the task.
Thank you for taking the time of going through my code, there are more comments along the App.jsx and Button.jsx files where I wrote my code.
