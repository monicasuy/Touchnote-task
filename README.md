This is an app I made for a job interview with TouchNote.
The task was to create a React app that displayed cards with the Star Wars characters' name
height and hair colour with Next and Previous buttons that were disabled when the user reaches the
last and first page accordingly and a Sort button that would display the cards according to the mass of the characters.
I only know the basics of React so I know there must be things that could've been done in a better way, but I'm happy and proud of being able to figure out how to do everything that was asked of me.
I had been more focused on JavaScript lately and coming back to React was definitely a challenge, but I learned a lot while working on this task and definitely understand React better now.
The front-end isn't my best work but I did try to use the Star Wars colours and found a similar(ish) font on google fonts to try and go with the theme of the task.
Thank you for taking the time of going through my code, there are more comments along the App.jsx and Button.jsx files where I wrote my code.
